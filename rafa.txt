Top seed Rafael Nadal clinched his 37th clay-court title on Sunday as he defeated David Nalbandian 6-2, 6-3 in the final of the Brasil Open 2013 in Sao Paulo. 

It is the Spaniard’s first trophy since winning at Roland Garros (d. Djokovic) in June 2012. He returned last week from a seven-month injury lay-off by reaching the singles (l. to Zeballos) and doubles (w/Monaco) finals at the VTR Open in Vina del Mar.

The 26-year-old Nadal won his first indoor clay-court tournament as he improved to a 51-22 record in tour-level finals. The left-hander received 250 Emirates ATP Rankings points and $82,300 in prize money.

It is the second time Nadal has won this ATP World Tour 250 tournament. On his only previous appearance in 2005, when the tournament was staged outdoors in Costa do Sauipe, the Mallorcan triumphed with victory over Alberto Martin.

Playing against former World No. 3 Nalbandian for the seventh time, Nadal reeled off four straight games from 2-2 to take the opening set. The Manacor native then rallied from a 0-2 deficit in the second set to win six of the last seven games and claim victory in 78 minutes. He improved to a 5-2 lead over Nalbandian in their FedEx ATP Head2Head series.

The 31-year-old Nalbandian dropped to an 11-13 finals record. The Argentine was contesting his first clay-court final in almost five years, since finishing runner-up at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in Acapulco in 2008 (l. to Almagro).
